It Began With The Inhaler

Amphetamines were first synthesized in 1887, but it took the invention of the bronchial inhaler by Smith, Kline and French in 1927 to really kickstart their use. People soon discovered than when soaked in water, coffee or alcohol, the humble inhaler made an intensely powerful brew. This little trick spawned a host of products with "brain" or "pep", cheap and easy pick-me-ups for a population trying to keep up with the rapid industrialization of the Western world. Thus began a relentless commercial exploitation that would last over 50 years.

Pep Pills

In 1946, amphetamines were the number one prescribed medicine for 39 different ailments, including seasickness, migraine, impotence, weight-loss and fatigue. Most amphetamine-based cures were available over the counter until 1956, when the UK government, after news of rampant addiction in Japan, made them prescription only. just inhale However, there was one exception: the bronchial inhaler, which is still for sale, not just in chemists but any and every shop. Thousands of users who needed to salve their addictions took to buying the inhalers, as it contained hundreds of times more amphetamine than the pills. Sales skyrocketed.

C Is For Craving

Pharmaceutical giants soon muscled in on the act. By 1900, German giant Merck (who, incidentally, also synthesized MDMA or Ecstasy) was producing over 1.5 tons a year of pure cocaine hydrochloride. Meanwhile, their US competitor, Parke Davis (developers of ketamine and PCP) was marketing its brands as a substance that could "make the coward brave, and the silent eloquent". The flipside of cocaine use, however, was beginning to be noticed. Some users were getting into trouble. Occasional users seemed to be okay, but chronic heavy users were experiencing cocaine addiction, withdrawal symptoms, and psychosis back to top

The Golden Era of Cocaine

the real thing For a substance as illegal as cocaine, it's interesting to note that it also had its so-called "Golden Era". That was when a number of products containing varying amounts of cocaine were sold commercially-and legally. One of the most famous cocaine products was Vin Mariani, the first of many cocaine-based wines. Jules Verne, who wrote Around The World In 80 Days, drank it; Louis Bleriot had a bottle in his cockpit during his strangely-accelerated flight across the English Channel. Bartholidi, the architect responsible for the Statue of Liberty, declared:

Cocaine, Leg Warmers & Drug Wars

If LSD was the 60s and Ecstasy was the 90s, the drug that characterized the 80s was undoubtedly cocaine. The memories and cultural achievements of the decade taste forgot should be enough evidence to stop coke use forever. Here are a few: deedy boppers, Duran Duran, shellsuits, perms, leg warmers, estate agents - the list is endless. Cocaine use hit its peak in the US in 1985 with over 5.7 million users (nearly 3% of the population) using cocaine at least "once every month".

Cocaine Medicine

Before the West came to South America, the coca bush was highly revered by its indigenous population as a "divine plant". The Incas used its leaves as currency. The Peruvians chewed them as fuel for high altitude treks and measured their journeys in "cicadas" - the time between doses of coca. In the 16th century, the Spaniards came and tried to eradicate its unholy use. They, however, learned their native slaves wouldn't work without it. It took until the mid-19th century for the industrialized West to get a taste of Peru's 4,000-year-old secret, as German pediatrician Albert Niemann extracted cocaine hydrochloride from coca leaves in 1860.

Ecstasy Therapy

the first nibble Before smileys, glow sticks and Mitsubishis, before raves and techno, Ecstasy had a lengthy, respected, and legal career as a psychotherapeutic drug. MDMA had been chanced upon by the German pharmaceutical company Merck in 1912 (they also extracted cocaine from coca leaves around the same time). It was patented but since it had no obvious use it soon disappeared off the radar. Contrary to rumors, it was not developed as a diet pill. healing the mind In 1965, the American biochemist Alexander Shulgin rediscovered Ecstasy while searching for psychotherapeutic drugs.

Heroin History

Heroin, like cocaine, tobacco and most illegal recreational drugs, began life as a 'wonder cure'. In 1900, the German pharmaceutical company Bayer came up with the brand name, Heroin, after heroisch, a German word for something with a pronounced effect even in small doses. It was used enthusiastically all over the world to treat respiratory diseases and even to combat morphine addiction, despite being twice as habit-forming itself. addictive Gradually however people began to notice heroin wasn't quite so wonderful. Patients tended to become highly addicted very quickly with pronounced withdrawal symptoms if the drug was taken away.

Opium Dreams

Before heroin, there was opium, which is almost as old as civilization itself. As early as 1600BC, the Egyptians were using opium to calm crying infants. Over 2000 years later, the Victorians invented Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup, an opiate-laden elixir which ensured that children remained seen but not heard. Ancient civilizations were well aware of opium's habit-forming qualities but it took a long time for Western medicine to learn from the ancestors. The Chinese suffered the most. When Portuguese traders sold pipes and tobacco from South America alongside opium from the Middle East, 18th century Chinese society got into opium-smoking in a big way, in plague-sized proportions.

Where Does Ketamine Come From?

Like LSD, MDMA (Ecstasy) and its close chemical cousin PCP, Ketamine is a product of twentieth century pharmacy, and to this day a healthy revenue source for 'big medicine'. Ketamine was discovered in 1961 by Dr. Cal Stevens of Wayne State University. The pharmaceutical giant Parke-Davis (now Pfizer) funded its development as an alternative anesthetic to Phencyclidine or PCP. angel dust Now no longer made, PCP (or 'Angel Dust') gained a bad reputation thanks to its unpredictable and frightening side-effects, such as psychotic aggression. Smoking PCP got James Brown in hot water, as he was caught speeding and waving a gun around in South Carolina.

LSD Accident

The discovery of LSD was pretty much an accident, and it happened on Friday, April 16, 1943, in Basle, Switzerland. For eight years, chemist Prof Albert Hofmann had been methodically synthesizing new molecules from ergot, a fungus which grows on diseased rye. Ergot had an intriguing contradictory reputation. On the one hand, it was highly-regarded in folk medicine for speeding up the contractions during childbirth. On the other, it was the cause of St. Anthony's Fire, a horrific scourge that had blighted entire Medieval villages with gangrene, madness and death when it infected their grain stores. back to top

LSD Cure

the miracle cure In the 1950s drug therapy was in its infancy. There was no Prozac, no anti-depressants, no anti-psychotic drugs. But then came LSD, a drug that appeared to open up emotions, dissolve defenses, and make available much of the unconscious. It could cure alcoholics and cure mental illness. It was cheap and easy to make. It looked like another "miracle cure". Sandoz, keen to make a profit from Prof. Hoffman's bizarre discovery, trade-named Delysid and began sending samples out to psychiatric researchers. back to top

The Banker & The Mushroom Gods

the mushroom gods Psychedelic mushrooms have been around as long as humanity. The Incas called them teonanactl or 'flesh of the gods'. The Aztecs considered them divine and referred to a trip as "the flowery dream". Prehistoric Saharan tribes painted mushroom-headed figures on cave walls. Siberian shamans fed their reindeer fly agaric mushrooms and then drank their urine to journey to the spirit world. They would also drink each other's urine, and the mushroom could be passed through the bodies of half a dozen people before their potency was lost.

Tune in, Drop Acid, And Get Arrested

After their discovery in 1955, magic mushrooms remained the domain of middle-class botanists and adventurers who hightailed it to Mexico to follow R. Gordon Wasson's trail Meanwhile, Swiss biochemist Albert Hoffman, the creator of LSD, was studying the mushrooms in his lab and was soon to isolate the stable active ingredient, psilocybin. By 1958, his company, Sandoz, was sending out little pink pills of psilocybin to curious psychologists and therapists all over the world. the high priest One such package arrived on the doorstep of Harvard psychology professor Timothy Leary.

Heroin Is Harmless

At a hearing to determine the future of heroin on April 3rd 1924, a congressional committee heard evidence from many expert witnesses. The US surgeon general of the time, Rupert Blue, declared heroin "poisonous" and said it caused insanity. Dana Hubbard of the New York City health department concluded: "Heroin addicts spring from sin and crime...Society in general must protect itself from the influence of evil, and there is no greater peril than heroin" Unsurprisingly, the US banned heroin on the spot. Shortly afterwards they embarked on a worldwide campaign to eradicate this evil. Thus began the "War On Drugs". Problem was, nothing said at the hearing was true. 

No matter which testing method you’ve chosen—hair, urine, or saliva—you receive the same drug testing results. Of the three results, two are very straightforward. The inconclusive result, however, is a little more complicated. Let’s break down the specifics of drug testing results.

All laboratories that process drug tests are prepared to perform two tests on a specimen. The first test is a type of immunoassay test. If the specimen tests positive for drugs, it undergoes a second test. The gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) test confirms the IA test result in urine and saliva test samples. It also records the drug level.

The liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LS/MS) test yields the same result in hair tests but it takes a bit longer to receive the results.
Negative test result

Although drug use is likely in every industry, it’s not the norm by any means. The majority of employee drug tests return with a negative result.

A negative drug test result is evidence that there are no drugs in the system.

However, the urine test can occasionally yield a false negative result. That’s because urine tests require the privacy of a restroom to collect the test sample. Some employees are “lucky” enough to make it through the test having substituted or tampered with the sample.

Possible ways to falsify the urine drug test are:

    Substituting the specimen with someone else’s or synthetic urine
    Diluting the specimen
    Adulterating the specimen

There are companies that claim they have developed products that detoxify the body—that’s code for “mask drug use.” However, these products usually contain very specific directions and failure to follow them to a “t” result in a failed test.

The instructions include drinking specific amounts of water and even urinating “x” number of times prior to the test. Odds are that if it “worked,” it was merely because a diluted specimen went undetected.
Positive test result

When a drug test returns with a positive result, it detected drugs.

Employers who drug test have policies in place outlining the process to follow when an employee tests positive for drugs. Many companies mirror their drug testing policies after those of the DOT.

The DOT (Department of Transportation), requires that an MRO (Medical Review Officer) review all test results. Positive results warrant contacting the employee to inform them of the result. The employee is given a chance to explain any medical reason that would cause a positive result. This includes a written statement from their physician explaining why the medication was prescribed. The statement should also document why the physician believes it’s okay for the employee to keep working while taking the drug.

If the employee’s explanation and evidence are accepted by the MRO, the test result is changed to negative. The MRO reports their findings to the company representative who then reports the findings to the employer.

A safety-sensitive employee who tests positive for drug use is immediately removed from service. They aren’t allowed back to work until completing the return to duty process which includes successfully completing a rehabilitation program and a negative drug test result.

Someone employed in the general workforce may simply be terminated rather than suspended until completing a “return to duty” process. However, we’ll note that ultimately it’s left to the safety-sensitive employer whether or not the employer returns to work at the same company.
Last chance

Last chance agreements, also called second chance agreements, are becoming more popular among employers though. These agreements basically state that an employee failing a drug test won’t lose their job if they follow certain conditions of continued employment. Moreover, they’re often written to reflect a specific set of conditions. For instance, someone who tests positive for marijuana use may not follow the same steps as someone who has tested positive for heroin and exhibits signs of a serious addiction.

Furthermore, some states have laws in place that prohibit employers from terminating an employee who comes to them admitting they have a substance abuse problem—if the employee is seeking help for the first time.
Inconclusive test results

The inconclusive result in itself is simple to define. The test couldn’t determine either a positive or negative result.

It’s the why of it all that contains different information regarding this test result though.
Adulterated or substituted specimens

Laboratory equipment has become increasingly sophisticated and laboratory technicians have long been wise to the drug communities’ attempts to falsify employee drug test results.

Adulterated or substituted specimens include  the following:

    Synthetic urine—This is the most recent wave of “beat the test” technology. Synthetic urine was discovered by accident but serves its place in the scientific community. However, somewhere along the way, manufacturers discovered the benefit of promoting the sale of the stuff as a means to pass urine drug tests. It’s illegal to manufacture or sell synthetic urine in many states.
    Positive dilute—When this explanation accompanies an inconclusive drug test result it means that even though the specimen contained too much water, there were also drugs detected. It also points toward the fact that the employee may have been trying to mask drug use. Employers follow company policy that dictates steps taken in the event of a positive drug test result.
    Negative dilute—A negative dilute explanation indicates that no drugs were identified, however, the specimen contained too much water. Again, employers often assume the employee was trying to mask drug use. Some companies request the employee to immediately submit to a second drug test. If given the opportunity to retake the test, employers view a refusal to test as grounds for termination.

Drug testing results in a safer workplace

There’s no question that companies that drug test employees deter drug use in the workplace. Most employees value their jobs and won’t risk occasional drug use when they know their employer drug tests.

It’s just not worth the risk.

Some employees might not be able to refrain though. Addicts are well-known for rationalizing their drug use. They may not even have admitted to themselves that they have a problem even when it becomes blatantly evident to everyone around them.

Employers that drug test want to make their work environment as safe as possible for everyone. Likewise, they have the opportunity to point an employee who’s tested positive for drugs toward help.

A kind word showing that you truly care about your employee’s well-being, even if it’s while explaining your reason for termination, could inspire them to seek help for their problem.

Natural highs are the only true highs. If you want a pure and lasting feeling of euphoria, find ways to achieve highs on your own without putting unhealthy substances into your body.

We look to outside sources to give us the high, the courage, and the inspiration we want. To get these things we drink alcohol and coffee, we ingest and smoke drugs, and we eat sweets and high-fat foods.

Alcohol provides a false courage and a short-lived high followed by the opposite emotions when you’re hung over. Drugs give you an artificial high followed the extreme opposite when you’re coming down. Coffee gives you a short rush of energy followed by just the opposite feeling. Sweets give you a jolt of pleasure followed by just the opposite as your body crashes from all the sugar.

None of these substances provides a high that you can rely on. And the damage they can cause to your body, psyche, and productivity greatly outweighs the short high not to mention the amount of wasted time in recovery (hangover) afterward.

Natural highs are self-created from within. They are lasting, pure, and they give you greater mental ability, emotional strength, and energy. Alcohol, drugs, sugar, and coffee gradually take these things away.

Wouldn’t you rather learn how to generate natural highs on your own and not have to rely on drugs, food, circumstances, or other people to feel good?

There are many things that you can do to get a natural high. Many of them simulate the release of endorphins in your brain giving you a feeling of euphoria. (Endorphins are brain chemicals known as neurotransmitters.) Here are 12 ways to get natural highs.

1. Be Courageous and Bold

When you do something that you are afraid of a natural high follows. The more courageous and bold the action the greater the high. In other words, the more afraid you are of something the greater the natural high after you have faced it.

Fear causes the release of endorphins in your brain. So part of your natural high comes from your body’s response to fear and part of it comes from the exhilaration you feel after overcoming a major personal obstacle, which also triggers the release of endorphins.

Here’s a great example. Public speaking is the number one fear for most people. What happens when a person faces this fear head on and delivers a speech successfully? They walk away from the podium with a natural high that lasts for hours and sometimes days! Aspiring public speakers often joke about how fearful they were before and during their speech. But once it was over, they wanted nothing more than to go right back to the podium and deliver another speech.

The fear of public speaking and the exhilaration of succeeding brings about the release of endorphins. No wonder public speakers want to return to the podium right after completing a speech. They are high and want another injection of endorphins!

I say get those natural highs any way that you can. When it comes to developing courage, you get the high and the rewards of being courageous.

2. Exercise

When you exercise vigorously, your brain releases the same endorphins that drugs trick your body into releasing except it is much purer, balanced, and no hangover or depression follows. In fact, it’s exactly the opposite. You feel joyful, inspired, and invigorated for hours after the initial rush. And it’s accumulative. The more regularly you exercise, the better your body gets at producing these highs.

Just the anticipation of the high motivates many people to exercise. And it doesn’t take much to bring about this effect. A brisk walk will do it.

Not only will exercise improve your health, increase your energy, and enhance your appearance, it will also get you high! I don’t see a downside, do you?

3. Make Love

Sexual activity brings about natural highs in three ways: (1) through vigorous physical activity, (2) emotional excitement, and (3) orgasm. Each of these causes the release of different amounts of endorphins.

Have you ever noticed how the euphoria lasts well beyond an orgasm? That’s because the endorphins are still flowing.

For obvious reasons, this is one of the best ways to get a natural high.

4. Get a Massage

One of the greatest pleasures in life is in getting a massage. Head and scalp, feet, and hands are particularly sensitive to a massage. It’s not hard to imagine how a good massage can induce natural highs.

A massage can also cause the release of endorphins. This is particularly true with a scalp and foot massage.

Just thinking about a massage, makes my eyelids heavy and my muscles beg for the skillful hands of a licensed massage therapist.

5. Listen to Uplifting Music

Music is a gift. Not only are the sounds pleasing to the human spirit, but the heartfelt message from the performer can also touch our souls.

Play some music that really moves you. I am talking about listening to a particular song or album that inspires you, increases your determination, and maybe even brings you to tears.

When I need inspiration while I am writing, I put on my earphones and play one of the songs that I have saved on my computer. The earphones allow me to listen to the music as loud as I want, block out outside noises, and avoid disturbing others.

Listening to music that really moves you also stimulates the release of those lovely endorphins. The greater the effect the music has on you the greater the release of endorphins.

6. Laugh Until it Hurts

Do you have a friend or family member that you laugh with endlessly every time you get together? Don’t you always feel great after you’ve laughed with them for an extended period, maybe until it hurts? Well, part of the reason is that deep heartfelt laughter brings about the release of endorphins too.

Of course, a portion of the natural high is brought about by the joy of spending time with someone you love. The icing on the cake is the endorphins that are released because of your ability to laugh so vigorously together.

How does that old saying go? “Laughter is the best medicine.” When that saying was coined, it probably wasn’t even known that laughter stimulates the release of endorphins. They must have suspected that something positive was going on inside the body.

Look for humor in your daily life, especially when things get tough. Lift yourself and others up with an endorphin laced joke rather than a poison-laced cocktail.

7. Eat Healthy Food

Eating healthy food provides an immediate intellectual high in knowing that you’re putting nutrients in your body that will enhance your health and appearance. It also provides a physical high as your body converts the healthy food into a strong and steady stream of energy and sense of well-being. Your body’s reaction to high sugar, salt, and fatty foods is just the opposite.

Eating chili peppers not only provides a vast array of health benefits, but they also stimulate the release of endorphins. Use them generously in your recipes for your health and for the natural highs that they produce.

8. Create a List of Your Dreams

Create a detailed list of your dreams in your mind. Imagine how you would feel if you were living those dreams right now!

The more vividly you imagine living your dreams in the present, the more intense the natural highs. Thinking about them coming true in the future isn’t nearly as effective. Picturing yourself as already living your dreams is much more powerful.

You might look at this activity as just wishful thinking. Nothing could be further from the truth. The more you can get yourself into the feeling place of having what you want the more you’ll draw those things into your life.

Here’s another way to look at this technique. How much inspiration and energy will you have to accomplish the things needed to achieve your dreams if you are constantly thinking and worrying about the fact that you don’t have them? None, right?

Positive and uplifting thoughts stimulate the release of endorphins as well. With this way of achieving your highs, you’ll never run out of “stuff.”

9. Be in the Present

When your thoughts are in the present, your mind is free of regrets about the past and worries about the future. Once you are completely in the present, a weight is lifted and you’re free to fully enjoy the things in front of you.

The New Thought movement states that what you think about you bring about. According to New Science, thoughts are energy GHVCTF{endogenous_levels_of. Therefore, every thought we have is a creation, good or bad. The only opportunity you have to create your life through your thoughts is in the present. Therefore, all of your power is in the present moment, and not in thoughts about the past or the future.

Staying in the moment and exercising this power produces exquisite natural highs!

10. Take a Walk in Nature

Go to any natural place near your home like a beach, park, or preserve. Before you arrive block out all your cares and worries. This isn’t a time to figure things out. This is a time to be in the present moment and to observe and appreciate the magnificence of nature. No synthetic substance can give you a purer natural high.

The peace that you can experience during these outings can refresh you in a way that provides greater clarity in what’s best for you in your life.

11. Do Something Kind for Someone in Need

Studies have shown that doing something for a person in need causes the release of endorphins in your brain.

I believe it works particularly well when you do something for someone you don’t know because there are no expectations on either side. I served food to the homeless one Thanksgiving day and it was one of the most fulfilling holidays of my life. I walked out of that event totally moved and inspired by what I had done and observed that day.

Even if you just give some change to a homeless person on a street corner, an unexpected natural high may follow.

12. Complete a Difficult Task

When you force yourself you to complete a difficult task, an intense feeling of accomplishment follows that provides a natural high. If you can get yourself into the feeling place of how you felt in the past when you finished a complicated job, you’ll have the motivation to complete the new one enthusiastically.

In contrast, the more you procrastinate, the bigger the job seems and the less motivated you become. If a lot of time passes, your concerns can turn to fear and loss of confidence. But once you face the task head on, your confidence returns, fear disappears, and the natural high is delivered upon completion.

Part of the cause for the natural high is the release endorphins, which is brought about by the exhilaration of finishing a challenging task.

Successful people rely on the anticipation of this “completion high” to inspire them toward greater and greater accomplishments.

***
If you look at the pluses and minus of a natural high in comparison to an unnatural high, the former comes out light years ahead.

Come on, let’s get a natural high!

No matter which testing method you’ve chosen—hair, urine, or saliva—you receive the same drug testing results. Of the three results, two are very straightforward. The inconclusive result, however, is a little more complicated. Let’s break down the specifics of drug testing results.

All laboratories that process drug tests are prepared to perform two tests on a specimen. The first test is a type of immunoassay test. If the specimen tests positive for drugs, it undergoes a second test. The gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) test confirms the IA test result in urine and saliva test samples. It also records the drug level.

The liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LS/MS) test yields the same result in hair tests but it takes a bit longer to receive the results.
Negative test result

Although drug use is likely in every industry, it’s not the norm by any means. The majority of employee drug tests return with a negative result.

A negative drug test result is evidence that there are no drugs in the system.

However, the urine test can occasionally yield a false negative result. That’s because urine tests require the privacy of a restroom to collect the test sample. Some employees are “lucky” enough to make it through the test having substituted or tampered with the sample.

Possible ways to falsify the urine drug test are:

    Substituting the specimen with someone else’s or synthetic urine
    Diluting the specimen
    Adulterating the specimen

There are companies that claim they have developed products that detoxify the body—that’s code for “mask drug use.” However, these products usually contain very specific directions and failure to follow them to a “t” result in a failed test.

The instructions include drinking specific amounts of water and even urinating “x” number of times prior to the test. Odds are that if it “worked,” it was merely because a diluted specimen went undetected.
Positive test result

When a drug test returns with a positive result, it detected drugs.

Employers who drug test have policies in place outlining the process to follow when an employee tests positive for drugs. Many companies mirror their drug testing policies after those of the DOT.

The DOT (Department of Transportation), requires that an MRO (Medical Review Officer) review all test results. Positive results warrant contacting the employee to inform them of the result. The employee is given a chance to explain any medical reason that would cause a positive result. This includes a written statement from their physician explaining why the medication was prescribed. The statement should also document why the physician believes it’s okay for the employee to keep working while taking the drug.

If the employee’s explanation and evidence are accepted by the MRO, the test result is changed to negative. The MRO reports their findings to the company representative who then reports the findings to the employer.

A safety-sensitive employee who tests positive for drug use is immediately removed from service. They aren’t allowed back to work until completing the return to duty process which includes successfully completing a rehabilitation program and a negative drug test result.

Someone employed in the general workforce may simply be terminated rather than suspended until completing a “return to duty” process. However, we’ll note that ultimately it’s left to the safety-sensitive employer whether or not the employer returns to work at the same company.
Last chance

Last chance agreements, also called second chance agreements, are becoming more popular among employers though. These agreements basically state that an employee failing a drug test won’t lose their job if they follow certain conditions of continued employment. Moreover, they’re often written to reflect a specific set of conditions. For instance, someone who tests positive for marijuana use may not follow the same steps as someone who has tested positive for heroin and exhibits signs of a serious addiction.

Furthermore, some states have laws in place that prohibit employers from terminating an employee who comes to them admitting they have a substance abuse problem—if the employee is seeking help for the first time.
Inconclusive test results

The inconclusive result in itself is simple to define. The test couldn’t determine either a positive or negative result.

It’s the why of it all that contains different information regarding this test result though.
Adulterated or substituted specimens

Laboratory equipment has become increasingly sophisticated and laboratory technicians have long been wise to the drug communities’ attempts to falsify employee drug test results.

Adulterated or substituted specimens include  the following:

    Synthetic urine—This is the most recent wave of “beat the test” technology. Synthetic urine was discovered by accident but serves its place in the scientific community. However, somewhere along the way, manufacturers discovered the benefit of promoting the sale of the stuff as a means to pass urine drug tests. It’s illegal to manufacture or sell synthetic urine in many states.
    Positive dilute—When this explanation accompanies an inconclusive drug test result it means that even though the specimen contained too much water, there were also drugs detected. It also points toward the fact that the employee may have been trying to mask drug use. Employers follow company policy that dictates steps taken in the event of a positive drug test result.
    Negative dilute—A negative dilute explanation indicates that no drugs were identified, however, the specimen contained too much water. Again, employers often assume the employee was trying to mask drug use. Some companies request the employee to immediately submit to a second drug test. If given the opportunity to retake the test, employers view a refusal to test as grounds for termination.

Drug testing results in a safer workplace

There’s no question that companies that drug test employees deter drug use in the workplace. Most employees value their jobs and won’t risk occasional drug use when they know their employer drug tests.

It’s just not worth the risk.

Some employees might not be able to refrain though. Addicts are well-known for rationalizing their drug use. They may not even have admitted to themselves that they have a problem even when it becomes blatantly evident to everyone around them.

Employers that drug test want to make their work environment as safe as possible for everyone. Likewise, they have the opportunity to point an employee who’s tested positive for drugs toward help.

A kind word showing that you truly care about your employee’s well-being, even if it’s while explaining your reason for termination, could inspire them to seek help for their problem.

Natural highs are the only true highs. If you want a pure and lasting feeling of euphoria, find ways to achieve highs on your own without putting unhealthy substances into your body.

We look to outside sources to give us the high, the courage, and the inspiration we want. To get these things we drink alcohol and coffee, we ingest and smoke drugs, and we eat sweets and high-fat foods.

Alcohol provides a false courage and a short-lived high followed by the opposite emotions when you’re hung over. Drugs give you an artificial high followed the extreme opposite when you’re coming down. Coffee gives you a short rush of energy followed by just the opposite feeling. Sweets give you a jolt of pleasure followed by just the opposite as your body crashes from all the sugar.

None of these substances provides a high that you can rely on. And the damage they can cause to your body, psyche, and productivity greatly outweighs the short high not to mention the amount of wasted time in recovery (hangover) afterward.

Natural highs are self-created from within. They are lasting, pure, and they give you greater mental ability, emotional strength, and energy. Alcohol, drugs, sugar, and coffee gradually take these things away.

Wouldn’t you rather learn how to generate natural highs on your own and not have to rely on drugs, food, circumstances, or other people to feel good?

There are many things that you can do to get a natural high. Many of them simulate the release of endorphins in your brain giving you a feeling of euphoria. (Endorphins are brain chemicals known as neurotransmitters.) Here are 12 ways to get natural highs.

1. Be Courageous and Bold

When you do something that you are afraid of a natural high follows. The more courageous and bold the action the greater the high. In other words, the more afraid you are of something the greater the natural high after you have faced it.

Fear causes the release of endorphins in your brain. So part of your natural high comes from your body’s response to fear and part of it comes from the exhilaration you feel after overcoming a major personal obstacle, which also triggers the release of endorphins.

Here’s a great example. Public speaking is the number one fear for most people. What happens when a person faces this fear head on and delivers a speech successfully? They walk away from the podium with a natural high that lasts for hours and sometimes days! Aspiring public speakers often joke about how fearful they were before and during their speech. But once it was over, they wanted nothing more than to go right back to the podium and deliver another speech.

The fear of public speaking and the exhilaration of succeeding brings about the release of endorphins. No wonder public speakers want to return to the podium right after completing a speech. They are high and want another injection of endorphins!

I say get those natural highs any way that you can. When it comes to developing courage, you get the high and the rewards of being courageous.

2. Exercise

When you exercise vigorously, your brain releases the same endorphins that drugs trick your body into releasing except it is much purer, balanced, and no hangover or depression follows. In fact, it’s exactly the opposite. You feel joyful, inspired, and invigorated for hours after the initial rush. And it’s accumulative. The more regularly you exercise, the better your body gets at producing these highs.

Just the anticipation of the high motivates many people to exercise. And it doesn’t take much to bring about this effect. A brisk walk will do it.

Not only will exercise improve your health, increase your energy, and enhance your appearance, it will also get you high! I don’t see a downside, do you?

3. Make Love

Sexual activity brings about natural highs in three ways: (1) through vigorous physical activity, (2) emotional excitement, and (3) orgasm. Each of these causes the release of different amounts of endorphins.

Have you ever noticed how the euphoria lasts well beyond an orgasm? That’s because the endorphins are still flowing.

For obvious reasons, this is one of the best ways to get a natural high.

4. Get a Massage

One of the greatest pleasures in life is in getting a massage. Head and scalp, feet, and hands are particularly sensitive to a massage. It’s not hard to imagine how a good massage can induce natural highs.

A massage can also cause the release of endorphins. This is particularly true with a scalp and foot massage.

Just thinking about a massage, makes my eyelids heavy and my muscles beg for the skillful hands of a licensed massage therapist.

5. Listen to Uplifting Music

Music is a gift. Not only are the sounds pleasing to the human spirit, but the heartfelt message from the performer can also touch our souls.

Play some music that really moves you. I am talking about listening to a particular song or album that inspires you, increases your determination, and maybe even brings you to tears.

When I need inspiration while I am writing, I put on my earphones and play one of the songs that I have saved on my computer. The earphones allow me to listen to the music as loud as I want, block out outside noises, and avoid disturbing others.

Listening to music that really moves you also stimulates the release of those lovely endorphins. The greater the effect the music has on you the greater the release of endorphins.

6. Laugh Until it Hurts

Do you have a friend or family member that you laugh with endlessly every time you get together? Don’t you always feel great after you’ve laughed with them for an extended period, maybe until it hurts? Well, part of the reason is that deep heartfelt laughter brings about the release of endorphins too.

Of course, a portion of the natural high is brought about by the joy of spending time with someone you love. The icing on the cake is the endorphins that are released because of your ability to laugh so vigorously together.

How does that old saying go? “Laughter is the best medicine.” When that saying was coined, it probably wasn’t even known that laughter stimulates the release of endorphins. They must have suspected that something positive was going on inside the body.

Look for humor in your daily life, especially when things get tough. Lift yourself and others up with an endorphin laced joke rather than a poison-laced cocktail.

7. Eat Healthy Food

Eating healthy food provides an immediate intellectual high in knowing that you’re putting nutrients in your body that will enhance your health and appearance. It also provides a physical high as your body converts the healthy food into a strong and steady stream of energy and sense of well-being. Your body’s reaction to high sugar, salt, and fatty foods is just the opposite.

Eating chili peppers not only provides a vast array of health benefits, but they also stimulate the release of endorphins. Use them generously in your recipes for your health and for the natural highs that they produce.

8. Create a List of Your Dreams

Create a detailed list of your dreams in your mind. Imagine how you would feel if you were living those dreams right now!

The more vividly you imagine living your dreams in the present, the more intense the natural highs. Thinking about them coming true in the future isn’t nearly as effective. Picturing yourself as already living your dreams is much more powerful.

You might look at this activity as just wishful thinking. Nothing could be further from the truth. The more you can get yourself into the feeling place of having what you want the more you’ll draw those things into your life.

Here’s another way to look at this technique. How much inspiration and energy will you have to accomplish the things needed to achieve your dreams if you are constantly thinking and worrying about the fact that you don’t have them? None, right?

Positive and uplifting thoughts stimulate the release of endorphins as well. With this way of achieving your highs, you’ll never run out of “stuff.”

9. Be in the Present

When your thoughts are in the present, your mind is free of regrets about the past and worries about the future. Once you are completely in the present, a weight is lifted and you’re free to fully enjoy the things in front of you.

The New Thought movement states that what you think about you bring about. According to New Science, thoughts are energy. Therefore, every thought we have is a creation, good or bad. The only opportunity you have to create your life through your thoughts is in the present. Therefore, all of your power is in the present moment, and not in thoughts about the past or the future.

Staying in the moment and exercising this power produces exquisite natural highs!

10. Take a Walk in Nature

Go to any natural place near your home like a beach, park, or preserve. Before you arrive block out all your cares and worries. This isn’t a time to figure things out. This is a time to be in the present moment and to observe and appreciate the magnificence of nature. No synthetic substance can give you a purer natural high.

The peace that you can experience during these outings can refresh you in a way that provides greater clarity in what’s best for you in your life.

11. Do Something Kind for Someone in Need

Studies have shown that doing something for a person in need causes the release of endorphins in your brain.

I believe it works particularly well when you do something for someone you don’t know because there are no expectations on either side. I served food to the homeless one Thanksgiving day and it was one of the most fulfilling holidays of my life. I walked out of that event totally moved and inspired by what I had done and observed that day.

Even if you just give some change to a homeless person on a street corner, an unexpected natural high may follow.

12. Complete a Difficult Task

When you force yourself you to complete a difficult task, an intense feeling of accomplishment follows that provides a natural high. If you can get yourself into the feeling place of how you felt in the past when you finished a complicated job, you’ll have the motivation to complete the new one enthusiastically.

In contrast, the more you procrastinate, the bigger the job seems and the less motivated you become. If a lot of time passes, your concerns can turn to fear and loss of confidence. But once you face the task head on, your confidence returns, fear disappears, and the natural high is delivered upon completion.

Part of the cause for the natural high is the release endorphins, which is brought about by the exhilaration of finishing a challenging task.

Successful people rely on the anticipation of this “completion high” to inspire them toward greater and greater accomplishments.

***
If you look at the pluses and minus of a natural high in comparison to an unnatural high, the former comes out light years ahead.

Come on, let’s get a natural high!

It Began With The Inhaler

Amphetamines were first synthesized in 1887, but it took the invention of the bronchial inhaler by Smith, Kline and French in 1927 to really kickstart their use. People soon discovered than when soaked in water, coffee or alcohol, the humble inhaler made an intensely powerful brew. This little trick spawned a host of products with "brain" or "pep", cheap and easy pick-me-ups for a population trying to keep up with the rapid industrialization of the Western world. Thus began a relentless commercial exploitation that would last over 50 years.

Pep Pills

In 1946, amphetamines were the number one prescribed medicine for 39 different ailments, including seasickness, migraine, impotence, weight-loss and fatigue. Most amphetamine-based cures were available over the counter until 1956, when the UK government, after news of rampant addiction in Japan, made them prescription only. just inhale However, there was one exception: the bronchial inhaler, which is still for sale, not just in chemists but any and every shop. Thousands of users who needed to salve their addictions took to buying the inhalers, as it contained hundreds of times more amphetamine than the pills. Sales skyrocketed.

C Is For Craving

Pharmaceutical giants soon muscled in on the act. By 1900, German giant Merck (who, incidentally, also synthesized MDMA or Ecstasy) was producing over 1.5 tons a year of pure cocaine hydrochloride. Meanwhile, their US competitor, Parke Davis (developers of ketamine and PCP) was marketing its brands as a substance that could "make the coward brave, and the silent eloquent". The flipside of cocaine use, however, was beginning to be noticed. Some users were getting into trouble. Occasional users seemed to be okay, but chronic heavy users were experiencing cocaine addiction, withdrawal symptoms, and psychosis back to top

The Golden Era of Cocaine

the real thing For a substance as illegal as cocaine, it's interesting to note that it also had its so-called "Golden Era". That was when a number of products containing varying amounts of cocaine were sold commercially-and legally. One of the most famous cocaine products was Vin Mariani, the first of many cocaine-based wines. Jules Verne, who wrote Around The World In 80 Days, drank it; Louis Bleriot had a bottle in his cockpit during his strangely-accelerated flight across the English Channel. Bartholidi, the architect responsible for the Statue of Liberty, declared:

Cocaine, Leg Warmers & Drug Wars

If LSD was the 60s and Ecstasy was the 90s, the drug that characterized the 80s was undoubtedly cocaine. The memories and cultural achievements of the decade taste forgot should be enough evidence to stop coke use forever. Here are a few: deedy boppers, Duran Duran, shellsuits, perms, leg warmers, estate agents - the list is endless. Cocaine use hit its peak in the US in 1985 with over 5.7 million users (nearly 3% of the population) using cocaine at least "once every month".

Cocaine Medicine

Before the West came to South America, the coca bush was highly revered by its indigenous population as a "divine plant". The Incas used its leaves as currency. The Peruvians chewed them as fuel for high altitude treks and measured their journeys in "cicadas" - the time between doses of coca. In the 16th century, the Spaniards came and tried to eradicate its unholy use. They, however, learned their native slaves wouldn't work without it. It took until the mid-19th century for the industrialized West to get a taste of Peru's 4,000-year-old secret, as German pediatrician Albert Niemann extracted cocaine hydrochloride from coca leaves in 1860.

Ecstasy Therapy

the first nibble Before smileys, glow sticks and Mitsubishis, before raves and techno, Ecstasy had a lengthy, respected, and legal career as a psychotherapeutic drug. MDMA had been chanced upon by the German pharmaceutical company Merck in 1912 (they also extracted cocaine from coca leaves around the same time). It was patented but since it had no obvious use it soon disappeared off the radar. Contrary to rumors, it was not developed as a diet pill. healing the mind In 1965, the American biochemist Alexander Shulgin rediscovered Ecstasy while searching for psychotherapeutic drugs.

Heroin History

Heroin, like cocaine, tobacco and most illegal recreational drugs, began life as a 'wonder cure'. In 1900, the German pharmaceutical company Bayer came up with the brand name, Heroin, after heroisch, a German word for something with a pronounced effect even in small doses. It was used enthusiastically all over the world to treat respiratory diseases and even to combat morphine addiction, despite being twice as habit-forming itself. addictive Gradually however people began to notice heroin wasn't quite so wonderful. Patients tended to become highly addicted very quickly with pronounced withdrawal symptoms if the drug was taken away.

Opium Dreams

Before heroin, there was opium, which is almost as old as civilization itself. As early as 1600BC, the Egyptians were using opium to calm crying infants. Over 2000 years later, the Victorians invented Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup, an opiate-laden elixir which ensured that children remained seen but not heard. Ancient civilizations were well aware of opium's habit-forming qualities but it took a long time for Western medicine to learn from the ancestors. The Chinese suffered the most. When Portuguese traders sold pipes and tobacco from South America alongside opium from the Middle East, 18th century Chinese society got into opium-smoking in a big way, in plague-sized proportions.

Where Does Ketamine Come From?

Like LSD, MDMA (Ecstasy) and its close chemical cousin PCP, Ketamine is a product of twentieth century pharmacy, and to this day a healthy revenue source for 'big medicine'. Ketamine was discovered in 1961 by Dr. Cal Stevens of Wayne State University. The pharmaceutical giant Parke-Davis (now Pfizer) funded its development as an alternative anesthetic to Phencyclidine or PCP. angel dust Now no longer made, PCP (or 'Angel Dust') gained a bad reputation thanks to its unpredictable and frightening side-effects, such as psychotic aggression. Smoking PCP got James Brown in hot water, as he was caught speeding and waving a gun around in South Carolina.

LSD Accident

The discovery of LSD was pretty much an accident, and it happened on Friday, April 16, 1943, in Basle, Switzerland. For eight years, chemist Prof Albert Hofmann had been methodically synthesizing new molecules from ergot, a fungus which grows on diseased rye. Ergot had an intriguing contradictory reputation. On the one hand, it was highly-regarded in folk medicine for speeding up the contractions during childbirth. On the other, it was the cause of St. Anthony's Fire, a horrific scourge that had blighted entire Medieval villages with gangrene, madness and death when it infected their grain stores. back to top

LSD Cure

the miracle cure In the 1950s drug therapy was in its infancy. There was no Prozac, no anti-depressants, no anti-psychotic drugs. But then came LSD, a drug that appeared to open up emotions, dissolve defenses, and make available much of the unconscious. It could cure alcoholics and cure mental illness. It was cheap and easy to make. It looked like another "miracle cure". Sandoz, keen to make a profit from Prof. Hoffman's bizarre discovery, trade-named Delysid and began sending samples out to psychiatric researchers. back to top

The Banker & The Mushroom Gods

the mushroom gods Psychedelic mushrooms have been around as long as humanity. The Incas called them teonanactl or 'flesh of the gods'. The Aztecs considered them divine and referred to a trip as "the flowery dream". Prehistoric Saharan tribes painted mushroom-headed figures on cave walls. Siberian shamans fed their reindeer fly agaric mushrooms and then drank their urine to journey to the spirit world. They would also drink each other's urine, and the mushroom could be passed through the bodies of half a dozen people before their potency was lost.

Tune in, Drop Acid, And Get Arrested

After their discovery in 1955, magic mushrooms remained the domain of middle-class botanists and adventurers who hightailed it to Mexico to follow R. Gordon Wasson's trail Meanwhile, Swiss biochemist Albert Hoffman, the creator of LSD, was studying the mushrooms in his lab and was soon to isolate the stable active ingredient, psilocybin. By 1958, his company, Sandoz, was sending out little pink pills of psilocybin to curious psychologists and therapists all over the world. the high priest One such package arrived on the doorstep of Harvard psychology professor Timothy Leary.

Heroin Is Harmless

At a hearing to determine the future of heroin on April 3rd 1924, a congressional committee heard evidence from many expert witnesses. The US surgeon general of the time, Rupert Blue, declared heroin "poisonous" and said it caused insanity. Dana Hubbard of the New York City health department concluded: "Heroin addicts spring from sin and crime...Society in general must protect itself from the influence of evil, and there is no greater peril than heroin" Unsurprisingly, the US banned heroin on the spot. Shortly afterwards they embarked on a worldwide campaign to eradicate this evil. Thus began the "War On Drugs". Problem was, nothing said at the hearing was true.

The more regularly you exercise, the better your body gets at producing these highs.

Just the anticipation of the high motivates many people to exercise. And it doesn’t take much to bring about this effect. A brisk walk will do it.

Not only will exercise improve your health, increase your energy, and enhance your appearance, it will also get you high! I don’t see a downside, do you?

3. Make Love

Sexual activity brings about natural highs in three ways: (1) through vigorous physical activity, (2) emotional excitement, and (3) orgasm. Each of these causes the release of different amounts of endorphins.

Have you ever noticed how the euphoria lasts well beyond an orgasm? That’s because the endorphins are still flowing.

For obvious reasons, this is one of the best ways to get a natural high.

4. Get a Massage

One of the greatest pleasures in life is in getting a massage. Head and scalp, feet, and hands are particularly sensitive to a massage. It’s not hard to imagine how a good massage can induce natural highs.

A massage can also cause the release of endorphins. This is particularly true with a scalp and foot massage.

Just thinking about a massage, makes my eyelids heavy and my muscles beg for the skillful hands of a licensed massage therapist.

5. Listen to Uplifting Music

Music is a gift. Not only are the sounds pleasing to the human spirit, but the heartfelt message from the performer can also touch our souls.

Play some music that really moves you. I am talking about listening to a particular song or album that inspires you, increases your determination, and maybe even brings you to tears.

When I need inspiration while I am writing, I put on my earphones and play one of the songs that I have saved on my computer. The earphones allow me to listen to the music as loud as I want, block out outside noises, and avoid disturbing others.

Listening to music that really moves you also stimulates the release of those lovely endorphins. The greater the effect the music has on you the greater the release of endorphins.

6. Laugh Until it Hurts

Do you have a friend or family member that you laugh with endlessly every time you get together? Don’t you always feel great after you’ve laughed with them for an extended period, maybe until it hurts? Well, part of the reason is that deep heartfelt laughter brings about the release of endorphins too.

Of course, a portion of the natural high is brought about by the joy of spending time with someone you love. The icing on the cake is the endorphins that are released because of your ability to laugh so vigorously together.

How does that old saying go? “Laughter is the best medicine.” When that saying was coined, it probably wasn’t even known that laughter stimulates the release of endorphins. They must have suspected that something positive was going on inside the body.

Look for humor in your daily life, especially when things get tough. Lift yourself and others up with an endorphin laced joke rather than a poison-laced cocktail.

7. Eat Healthy Food

Eating healthy food provides an immediate intellectual high in knowing that you’re putting nutrients in your body that will enhance your health and appearance. It also provides a physical high as your body converts the healthy food into a strong and steady stream of energy and sense of well-being. Your body’s reaction to high sugar, salt, and fatty foods is just the opposite.

Eating chili peppers not only provides a vast array of health benefits, but they also stimulate the release of endorphins. Use them generously in your recipes for your health and for the natural highs that they produce.

8. Create a List of Your Dreams

Create a detailed list of your dreams in your mind. Imagine how you would feel if you were living those dreams right now!

The more vividly you imagine living your dreams in the present, the more intense the natural highs. Thinking about them coming true in the future isn’t nearly as effective. Picturing yourself as already living your dreams is much more powerful.

You might look at this activity as just wishful thinking. Nothing could be further from the truth. The more you can get yourself into the feeling place of having what you want the more you’ll draw those things into your life.

Here’s another way to look at this technique. How much inspiration and energy will you have to accomplish the things needed to achieve your dreams if you are constantly thinking and worrying about the fact that you don’t have them? None, right?

Positive and uplifting thoughts stimulate the release of endorphins as well. With this way of achieving your highs, you’ll never run out of “stuff.”

9. Be in the Present

When your thoughts are in the present, your mind is free of regrets about the past and worries about the future. Once you are completely in the present, a weight is lifted and you’re free to fully enjoy the things in front of you.

The New Thought movement states that what you think about you bring about. According to New Science, thoughts are energy. Therefore, every thought we have is a creation, good or bad. The only opportunity you have to create your life through your thoughts is in the present. Therefore, all of your power is in the present moment, and not in thoughts about the past or the future.

Staying in the moment and exercising this power produces exquisite natural highs!

10. Take a Walk in Nature

Go to any natural place near your home like a beach, park, or preserve. Before you arrive block out all your cares and worries. This isn’t a time to figure things out. This is a time to be in the present moment and to observe and appreciate the magnificence of nature. No synthetic substance can give you a purer natural high.

The peace that you can experience during these outings can refresh you in a way that provides greater clarity in what’s best for you in your life.

11. Do Something Kind for Someone in Need

Studies have shown that doing something for a person in need causes the release of endorphins in your brain.

I believe it works particularly well when you do something for someone you don’t know because there are no expectations on either side. I served food to the homeless one Thanksgiving day and it was one of the most fulfilling holidays of my life. I walked out of that event totally moved and inspired by what I had done and observed that day.

Even if you just give some change to a homeless person on a street corner, an unexpected natural high may follow.

12. Complete a Difficult Task

When you force yourself you to complete a difficult task, an intense feeling of accomplishment follows that provides a natural high. If you can get yourself into the feeling place of how you felt in the past when you finished a complicated job, you’ll have the motivation to complete the new one enthusiastically.

In contrast, the more you procrastinate, the bigger the job seems and the less motivated you become. If a lot of time passes, your concerns can turn to fear and loss of confidence. But once you face the task head on, your confidence returns, fear disappears, and the natural high is delivered upon completion.

Part of the cause for the natural high is the release endorphins, which is brought about by the exhilaration of finishing a challenging task.

Successful people rely on the anticipation of this “completion high” to inspire them toward greater and greater accomplishments.
